            <h1>About the Artist</h1>
            <p>Hello! Iâ€™m Marni Jane Bouwma, an artist currently living in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. I am completing a university degree in the Major of Visual Arts at the University of Ottawa, with a minor in psychology.</p>
            <p>Charcoal drawings are my current passion, but I also love to paint and make digital drawings. Primarily, I love to draw portraits, animals, and plants. I have also ventured into making abstract art, dealing with themes such as anxiety and depression. The last category that I consider part of my practice is my imaginary topographical maps, which I value as a way of dealing with my mental illnesses. I love to encourage others to try this out as a coping mechanism too. One of my main passions as an artist is helping others to realize their love of and abilities to do art. I think that it is so important to have creative outlets and to make beautiful things to surround ourselves with.</p>
