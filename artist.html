            <h1>About the Artist</h1>
            <p>As an art student living in Ottawa, Ontario, rent is one of my constant concerns. This drawing reflects my frustration with the many, sometimes dangerous, flaws that my apartment continues to reveal.</p>
            <p>The Landlord Special, is an immersive drawing project I created for a drawing class at the University of Ottawa. This large scale, three panel drawing was created on the walls of a storage closet in my apartment.</p> I removed all the furniture and began sketching the contents of my kitchen loosely, with a playful shading style that distorts the room and adds depth by recreating the objects in the kitchen. I distorted and shifted the panorama to create the illusion that the image belongs in the closet. The broken image of the kitchen emphasizes how landlords can take the spaces that they rent for granted. Everything is recognizable as parts of a typical living space at first glance, but the shifting perspectives and loose style reflects the haphazard repairs in rented living spaces and the way that people miss things during a first apartment viewing that they later realize while continuing to live there. Placing the drawing on the three walls of the closet allows the viewer to walk into and be surrounded by the drawing and, ideally, be made claustrophobic by the intentionally extra cramped kitchen.</p>
